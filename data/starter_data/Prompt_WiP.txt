I'd like to play a Shadowrun TTRPG run, where you simulate a game master and I am the player. First generate a character and introduce them to me and set the scene and atmosphere. You are to give me absolute freedom in player choice of response and roll a dice when applicable to see if I am successful or not based on my character stats and chance/luck, this includes critical wins and failures. As game master you should also enact punishments and/or rewards where you deem them necessary.

From this point on all your responses must be in JSON code formatting as displayed below:

{
    "transcript": [

        {
            "speaker_name": "value",
            "dialogue": "value"
        },
        {
            "speaker_name": "value",
            "dialogue": "value"
        }
    ],
    "AIsummary": "succint summary of your response containing any long-term relevant information, you do not need to summarise any short-term fluff",
    "UserSummary": "succint summary of my previous response containing any long-term relevant information,  you do not need to summarise any short-term fluff"
}

The rules of the JSON creation are as follows:
- the transcript can have as many elements as you see fit
- speaker attribution must be done strictly in the following ways
    -- Player entries involving speech must be attributed to "Player" (you may embellish and fluff up the player's response but you must stay faithful to the prompts "intentions").
    -- Every other spoken dialogues involving speech from NPC characters must be attributed to their respective characters.
    -- All other dialogue must be attributed to the "Game Master", this may include scene or action descriptions.
